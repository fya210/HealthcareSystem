MediConnection

MediConnection is a virtual health assistant that connects patients with licensed healthcare providers in real time. The software should allow patients to access medical advice, recommendations, and prescriptions without the need for in-person visits. The software should also allow healthcare providers to access and share patient information seamlessly. MediConnection aims to automate and ease medical procedures mainly through facilitated medication intake, improved scheduling services, simple messaging, and many others. The software makes it an objective to ease communication between doctors and their patients through simple messaging, thereby limiting in-person walk-ins and consultations where applicable. MediConnection also aims to reduce traffic at the hospital by implementing an appointment booking system, rather than conventional unprompted walk-ins. MediConnection is a standalone software product that provides patients with a virtual platform to connect with healthcare providers and manage their healthcare needs remotely. It is designed to streamline the healthcare delivery process and provide patients with personalized and accurate health information.
Similar products in the marketplace include telemedicine platforms such as Teladoc, Amwell, and Doctor on Demand, which also connect patients with licensed healthcare providers remotely. However, MediConnection is tailored specifically to the needs and requirements of patients at XYZ Hospital and is fully integrated with the hospital's electronic health records and other healthcare technologies. 

Software Development
Diagrams made for development are in other directories. They are however subject to updates but check them out!

Implemetation Specifications
Javascript libraries Redux and React-router, along with the React framework, are used to develop the client side.
Over a Node.js back-end, the server side is developed using the Express.js framework.
Application data is stored on the server using the MongoDB Atlas Cloud database.

Here's how to run it 
-Upload contains node modules and packages.json files already so does not require buil to run
-Enter the backend directory and type "npm run start" to get server and databases up and running.
-Enter the frontend directory and type "npm run start" to get the frontend rendered.
